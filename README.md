# Emergent Task Timer (ETT)

This is designed to help record where your time is _actually_ applied.  
The ETT is a stack of "task tracks" containing 15-minute bubbles of continuous time. Each track represents a distinct activity. 
This is heavily inspired by Dave Seah's [ETT](https://davidseah.com/2013/06/the-emergent-task-timer-revised-for-2013/) &copy; 2009-2013

## Features

- [ ] Record todays times, via tasks and time bubbles (24 hrs), no persistence
- [ ] Persist (offline-first)

## Design contraints

- deliver as single `index.html` file (possibly result of "compile" step)
- offline-first
